## Import medical calculators, simply as a python library!

***

The scope of this project is developing a python library in order to make frequently-used medical calculators easily available for data scientists and developers. The project would be published on recognized package managers as soon as it reaches a useful reliable state.
I am a cardiology resident. I appreciate contributions from coders, medical students/graduates and specialists in diffenet medical majors.


### What is the roadmap?
1. making a categorized list of useful medical calculators.
2. preparing a simple developers-documentation for contributors about code structures and global terminologies.
3. preparing the code for the first 5 calculators, and its related users-documentation.
4. publishing the primary version of the project as an installable python library using recognized package managers.
5. updating and extending the project regularly by adding more calculators, completing documentations, enhancing previous calculators and fxing possible bugs.


### Can I contribute?
Of Course!
At this starting point, we are in the 1st step of the roadmap. so, I am trying to make a list of useful calculators in different medical specialities. 
The project might be started by calculators in my Medical Speciality, "Cardiology" - I am a cardiology resident; However, any contribution for making a more comprehensive list of calculators -or further help in coding , documentation, etc.- would be appreciated.

### I don't know anything about medicine. can I contribute?
Of course! The world would be glad to have your help here in the coding procces, documentation or even editing and testing our codes which is so important and critical. if you had any questions, don't hesitate to send an e-mail to me : reza.shahnazar@gmail.com

### I am a medical student/graduate, But I can't help by coding. can I contribute?
YESS! please help :) !
first, We need You in completeing our categorized list of calculators.
second, We need you in preparing a scientific documentation of calculators we make.
third, If you know basics about python, we need you to test our library and send us feedback.
So, if you have any question, feel free to send me an e-mail: reza.shahnazar@gmail.com  I will do my best to explain anything you need.

### How exactly can I contribute?
1. You can fork the project, complete the calculators.md file and send a Pull request.
2. You can add comments or isuues directly to this repository.
3. You can send me an e-mail: reza.shahnazar@gmail.com ,and I would try my best to find a suitable way to have your help in this project.

### Can I contribute by adding codes?
Of course; However, As codes should have a unified architecture and terminology, I want to prepare a simple documentation about code structures and global terms in order for further usage in coding different parts of the library. So, I would be fascinated to see your codes after I prepare and publish this documentation here.
