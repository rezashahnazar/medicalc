### import all medical calculators, simply as a python library

The scope of this project is making a python library in order to make frequently-used medical calculators easily available for data scientists. The project would be published in package managers as soon as it reaches a useful reliable state.

## Can I contribute?
Of Course!
At this starting point, I am trying to make a list of useful calculators in different medical specialities. the project might be started by calculators in my Medical Speciality, "Cardiology" - I am a cardiology resident; However, any contribution for making a more comprehensive list of calculators or further help in coding , documentation, etc. would be appreciated.

## How exactly can I contribute?
1- You can fork the project, complete the calculators.md file and send a Pull request.
2- You can add comments or isuues directly to this repository.
3- You can send me an e-mail: reza.shahnazar@gmail.com ,and I would try my best to find a suitable way to have your help in this project.

## Can I contribute by coding calcualors?
Of course; However, As codes should have a unified architecture and terminology, I want to prepare a simple documentation about code structures and global terms in order for further usage in coding different parts of the library. So, I would be fascinated to see your codes after I prepare and publish this documentation here.
